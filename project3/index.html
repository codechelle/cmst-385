            <div id="bio">
                <p>Rico was born in D.C., and spent a few childhood years in New York and Virginia, but she’s lived most of her life in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Statistically, P.G. County is home to the wealthiest black-majority neighborhoods in the country, with a median household income of $75,000. Maria and her mom, however, lived right outside of those developments, in the less affluent Palmer Park.</p>

                <p>When she was in sixth grade, her parents enrolled her in a boarding school in Baltimore, in the hopes of providing her a better education than the one her school district offered. Unfortunately, she was expelled and sent back to a public school near home.</p>
                    
                <p>Returning from Baltimore, Rico felt different — “the weird one out the pack,” she says. Her new schoolmates, many of whom she’d known since elementary school, treated her with disdain. “They remembered when I left. And they was just like… ‘So you’re from Baltimore, now?’ And I’m like, ‘Bitch, I’m from the same spot.’ My mom did not move. We were still living in the fucking hood… That hard-ass switch from boarding school to a school in P.G. County, that shit was crazy as hell. They talked different. They dressed different.”</p>
                    
                <p>That, she says, is when Maria Kelly became Rico Nasty:<br> 
                    <blockquote>“I started doing shit the way I like to do it ‘cause I got tired of waiting on everybody else to do shit for me."</blockquote>
                </p>

                <p>As Rico’s career started to pick up, Malik became her manager too. She quit her day job as the front desk receptionist at a hospital; he started buying production equipment. He’s the only father figure that Cameron has ever known, although it’s not entirely clear to Rico what Cameron knows about his mother’s career. “When he sees [my music videos], he says, ‘Mama,’” she explains, “but I don’t think he knows that screaming-ass voice is me.” She does, however, know that his favorite song is “Key Lime OG,” one of the more successful singles off her last mixtape, Sugar Trap 2.</p>
